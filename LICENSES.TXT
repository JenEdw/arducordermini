In addition to the license(s), the author(s) of this project ask that you 
participate in the Open Hardware Better World pledge.

The spirit of the Open Hardware Better World pledge is the belief that 
a large portion of the social and economic issues that are present in 
portions of both the developed and undeveloped world are a direct 
response to poor literacy and poor education, and that helping to educate 
folks will enable them to make informed choices that effect positive 
social change.  

1) CHARITABLE DONATIONS: Should you take in revenue or otherwise profit 
   through the use of this project, you are kindly asked to donate at 
   least 1% of that revenue to a science education or basic literacy 
   charity of your choice.  You are encouraged to choose a charity that:
    - Does not discrimiate based on race, gender, faith, or sexual 
      orientation, and 
    - That uses at least 75% of its donations to further its 
      charitable mission (ie. not operating costs)
   
2) KEEPING IN TOUCH: Because there are few things better than learning
   that one of your projects has helped someone, should you use this 
   project to do amazing things, please consider sending a kind note to 
   the author(s) to let them know.  Their contact information is 
   in CONTRIB.TXT
